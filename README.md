[2,6,16,18,22,27]

# Big O Notation

By using (n*(n+1))/2 formula, this will lead us to  O(n^2)

#Time Complexity

Average Case: O(n^2)

Worst Case: O(n^2)

Best Case: n

Number 18 is at the middle of the array, so we should consider average case.

[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] By using sorting method mensioned in the video, the 4 steps will be:

[2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]

[2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]

[2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
